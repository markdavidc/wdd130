      <h3>Washer Steps</h3>
      <p>
        1. Separate your clothes into whites, lights, and darks.
        2. Treat stains with detergent immediately.
        3. Add detergent to the sliding drawer on a front-loading machine or to the tub of a top-loading machine.
        4. Add the right amount of detergent according to the package instructions.
        5. Use cold water most of the time or hot water only for very dirty laundry.
        6. Don't overfill the machine when you add your load. Around 3/4's full. 
        7. Set a timer and return to switch your laundry. You don't want to leave your clothes in the washer for too long.

      <h3>Dryer Steps</h3>
      <p>
        1. Remove lint from the lint trap before drying each load.
        2. 1 washer load = 1 dryer load.
        3. Use dryer sheets for softer, static-free clothes.
        4. Set a timer and return to switch your laundry.
